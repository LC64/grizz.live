          <p>I had yet to become aware of play, however I now wish I had been taught sooner. Looking back, I consider this time in my life to have been a waste. I mostly just plopped around, trying desperately to keep track of where my owner was. These were tumultuous, uncertain times.</p>

          <p>It was around this time that the "ball" was shown to me, and I was taught by my owner the game known as "fetch". From this point on, my life would never be the same. I now had purpose.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2013: Rise of Play</h3>
          <p>Play quickly became my singular goal in life. I had begun to develop an unquenchable thirst to get ball. I had even begun to catch ball right out of the air, so as to get ball faster. I was a natural.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2015: God of Play</h3>
          <p>For the next few years I honed my skills. I had become a very big dog. Bigger and faster than almost all other dogs. When it came to fetch I had no equal. Many were impressed by my abilities and often told me what a good boy I was. But for me it wasn't about the accolades. It was only about getting the ball. Why you ask? It's simple really. I got the ball so that it could be thrown, and I could get the ball again.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2016: Fall of Play</h3>
          <p>While my desire to play had remained unshakeable, I began to suspect my owner had grown quite weary of it. Sometimes after only the 20th consecutive fetch, my owner was ready to take a rest. "NO!" and "Go lay down!" became very familar phrases. When my owner refused to play and I could find nobody else to throw the ball, I would become incredibly frustrated. I needed MORE play. I needed it so badly it hurt. Had I become addicted? Was it wrong to seek constant play?</p>

              1. In his later years Grizz had been driven quite mad by the concept of play and more specifically the "laser pointer". He would often succumb to fits of worried barks merely from the reflection of silverware shining a light upon the ceiling. The impossible pursuit of the laser and other shining points of light drove him to insanity.
